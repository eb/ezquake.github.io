# Changes in 3.5 (not released, based on 3.1)

### Renderer changes

- General overview
  - Major source code re-organisation to support multiple rendering paths
  - Executable can be compiled specific to a single renderer or to have multiple (`/vid_renderer` to choose)
  - GLSL-only renderer added (requires OpenGL 4.3+)
  - Classic renderer uses more advanced OpenGL features if available, including GLSL
  - Threaded driver experience should be improved (removed glGet* calls for matrices etc)
  - Reduced state changes by caching all OpenGL state in memory
  - Reduced state changes by using trying to consistently use pre-multiplied alpha blending
  - Reduced state/texture changes by using atlas for as many 2D elements as practicable
- QMB particle system
  - Reduced state changes by using same pre-multiplied alpha when loading particle textures
  - Reduced hull traces by caching distance from nearest clipping plane
  - Reduced hull traces/frame by changing physics option for some particle types
  - Reduced particle count caused by particle trails spawning multiple trails/entity and trampling on trail end-point data (SF#292?)
  - Sparks appear at furthest point of beam (not clipping platform edges - SF#143, SF#5?)
  - Coronas around torches kick in when the centre of the flame is visible, and don't fade in (SF#51)
  - `/gl_nailtrail 1` replaced, should be significantly faster
  - `/gl_particle_fire 1` re-written, should be signficantly faster (SF#51)
  - `/gl_part_fasttrails` removed
- World rendering
  - `/r_nearclip` has minimum value 2, increased from 0.1 (lower values produce too many errors on 16-bit z-buffers)
  - `/r_farclip` has maximum value 16384, no previous limit set (again, 16-bit z-buffers)
  - `/gl_scaleskytextures` added to keep scaling for sky & world textures distinct (default: off)
  - `/gl_caustics` checks the center of worldmodels (not the origin - fixes #321)
  - `/gl_turb_ripple` removed
  - `/gl_motionblur` removed
- MD3 models
  - Powerup shells support added
  - Simpleitem replacements work as expected
  - Model hints set correctly when using MD3 models
  - Skin handling improved for MD3 models
  - Lighting improved
  - Outlining supported
- Entity rendering
  - Powerup shells are consistent size regardless of model's internal scaling factor
  - ng/sng are special cases to not lerp back to the frame 0 when firing stops
  - block lerping of vertices if they come from behind the player (instead of by distance)
  - `/r_lerpframes` only lerps frames in an animation sequence (mostly smooth, stops axe-script distortion)
  - `/gl_affinemodels` removed
  - `/gl_smoothmodels` removed
  - `/gl_motiontrails` removed
  - `/gl_mipmap_viewmodels` added: controls mipmapping of textures for viewmodel (stops muzzleflash bleeding on to edge of weapon)
  - `/gl_scaleModelSimpleTextures` added: controls scaling of simple item textures (previously used `gl_scalemodeltextures`)
- HUD rendering
  - 2D elements are added to a single atlas (will cause delay at startup or when loading new images)
  - Tracker, centerprint & QTV stats are all added as HUD elements
  - Tracker splits strings up as messages are created, not when rendering
  - HUD notify no longer loses last character on line if that is also last character on screen - SF#513
  - 2D elements no longer rounded to integer coordinates before rendering - SF#397
  - `score_bar` attributes can have formatting applied (`%<10r>T` etc)
  - `/fontload` added: proportional font support if freetype available (Windows requires freetype.dll)
  - `/fontlist` enumerates fonts available on system
  - `/gl_smoothfont` removed: now use `/r_smoothcrosshair`, `/r_smoothtext`, `/r_smoothimages`
  - `/gl_charsets_min` added: restricts to basic & cyrillic fonts during startup (vastly reduces number of attempted file opens)
  - `/r_drawdisc` added: option to disable the IO-indicator
  - `/r_tracker_inconsole` messages now have the image in the console rather than the name of the image
  - `/scr_new_hud_clear` removed, and is essentially always enabled
  - `/show_velocity_3d` removed
  - `/hud_speed_text_align 0` hides the text value (as per documentation)
- Lighting
  - Bugfix: `/gl_modulate` change now updates all lightmaps immediately
  - Software lighting (`/r_dynamic 1`) waits until all changes to the lightmap are logged, then uploads lightmap once per frame
  - Hardware lighting (`/r_dynamic 2`) available if compute shaders available - move lighting to GPU
  - Maximum number of dynamic lights has been reduced to 32, as the upper 32 weren't processed anyway due to bitflags overflow
  - If driver supports OpenGL 4.3 (or appropriate extensions), use driver-supplied preferred texture format
  - `/gl_lighting_colour` depends on `/gl_lighting_vertex`, should be more consistent
  - `/r_lightmap` removed - equivalent functionality via `/r_drawflat 1;/r_wallcolor 255 255 255;/r_floorcolor 255 255 255`
  - `/r_lightmap_lateupload` added - might give better performance for those using `-nomtex`
  - `/r_lightmap_packbytexture` added - very naive idea but reduces texture switches when rendering world (when texture arrays not available)
- Render to framebuffers
  - `/vid_framebuffer 1` - render to framebuffer
  - `/vid_framebuffer_width`/`height`/`scale` - resizes main buffer
  - `/vid_framebuffer 2` - renders the 3D scene to framebuffer but 2D elements (hud etc) at standard resolution
  - `/vid_framebuffer_palette 1` to use shader gamma/contrast etc (hardware is fastest & still default)
  - `/vid_framebuffer_hdr 1` to use float render buffer (required for `/vid_framebuffer_hdr_*` options)
  - `/r_fx_geometry 1` outlines the world based on surface normals, not surfaces.
- Modern OpenGL (GLSL)
  - `/vid_renderer 1` to enable in multi-renderer builds
  - `/vid_gl_core_profile 1` if you need/want a core profile.  Performance difference will vary per system/driver.
  - `/r_dynamic 2` to move surface lighting to GPU (cheapest 'hardware-lighting' possible, but quick for dm maps)
  - Seamless turb surface rendering
  - Expect delay when starting map, as textures/models are processed
  - Luma/skybox textures will be resized on load as required
- 'Classic' OpenGL (`/vid_renderer 0` in multi-renderer build)
  - All OpenGL state cached to reduce redundant state changes
  - Uses VBOs & batch draw calls (opengl 2.0-ish)
  - Lightmap rendering in OpenGL 1.1 fixed
  - Can use framebuffers for software gamma/palette changes (depends on extensions)
  - Skyboxes will render using cubemaps if using OpenGL 3.2+ (minor performance boost, depends on number of sky surfaces)
  - `/r_program_XXX` controls if the program will try to use GLSL for that particular aspect of rendering
  - `/r_fastturb 0` rendering performance improved
  - `/r_drawflat 2` and `/r_drawflat 3` rendering performance improved (drawflat surfaces have their own chain)
  - `/r_bloom` & `/r_drawviewmodel` used in combination greatly reduced bloom effect (advise setting `/r_bloom_alpha` lower if you now find effect overpowering). (SF#296,SF#297,SF#393)
  - `/gl_ext_arb_texture_non_power_of_two` removed (use `-nonpot` command-line option instead)
  - `/gl_maxtmu2` removed (use `-maxtmu2` instead)
- Other changes
  - `/cl_bob` affects weapon again, not just the player's head
  - `/cl_bobhead` allows `/cl_bob` settings to **only** affect the weapon model and not the player's head
  - `/gl_simpleitems_orientation 2`: simple items stay upright when camera is affected by rollangle

### Documentation
- Macros are explicitly enumerated, and have their own documentation.json file
- Command-line parameters are explicitly enumerated, and have their own documentation.json file
- Client can generate its own documentation.json files, including default values for variables

### General changes
- Bugfix: players no longer highlighted as sending VOIP when `-nosound` command-line option used
- Bugfix: invalid demo_dir caused demo browser to be empty & locked (SF#283 - related bug, anyway)
- Bugfix: files are identified as archive if extension is not lower-case (SF#313)
- Bugfix: healthdamage/armordamage reset when point of view changes (SF#146)
- Bugfix: maps with sky texture named "SKY*" instead of "sky*" could lead to memory corruption
- Bugfix: on OSX, processor information string was left pointing to stack-allocated memory
- Bugfix: `/cl_fakeshaft` is disabled during intermission, so auto-screenshots should no longer have an LG beam
- Teamfortress: block r_skincolormode working on TF or other server with skin/color forcing enabled
- Teamfortress: color in scoreboard is set based on team name if on TF server (team renaming not supported)
- The hunk is no longer used to store skins & models, only maps (no cached data being flushed and reloaded)
- In competitive rulesets, logging console to disk is disabled during match
- Server: PR1 strings overflowing integer offset stored in lookup table with negative integer instead (Windows 64-bit)
- Some commands have been renamed dev_* and are only available when running with `-dev` on command line (req by dopeskillz)
- Filesystem startup no longer lists .pak files being opened, lists `/path` after completion instead (SF#354)
- `/file_browser_sort_archives` added - if set, archives are still at top of list, but sorted in same way files are (SF#273)
- `/cl_startupdemo` shouldn't conflict with `/cl_onload` options (SF#467,SF#468)
- `/cl_clock_format` can be changed when connected to server and has same values/logic as `/hud_clock_format`
- `/scr_shownick_order` can be changed when connected to server
- `/timedemo` automatically raises console as demo starts
- Context creation changed, if context can't be created msaa/24bit-depth/hw-accel/srgb then various fallbacks attempted (previously only msaa), rather than falling back directly to software rendering
- cvars limited by ruleset max/min values weren't checked during application-startup
- toggling console exits hud_editor mode
- default.cfg executes on config load/reset (default.cfg in id1/pak0.pak & nQuake is ignored)

### Changeover issues/notes

- If you are using particle explosions/effects and notice small artifacts around the smoke etc, check your particlefont.png and make sure it doesn't have any stray non-alpha pixels around 64-pixel boundaries.  ezQuake 3.5 takes the particle font and splits it into component textures, so any errors around the edges will be more visible (reported with config set to `/r_explosionType 1`, `/gl_part_explosions 1`)
